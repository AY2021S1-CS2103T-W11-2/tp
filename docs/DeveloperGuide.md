## **Introduction**

###Purpose
The purpose of this document is to cover the multi-level design architecture of JARVIS, so that the intended audience
of this document can understand the relationship between components that make up JARVIS.

###Audience
This developer guide is for anyone who wants to understand the internal software architecture of JARVIS.
The following groups of people are the intended audience:
* JARVIS developers: anyone who wish to upgrade JARVIS to support more functions.
* CS1101S Avengers: tutors of CS1101S who wants to improve their efficiency and productivity.

###JARVIS Overview
JARVIS is a desktop app for CS1101S Teaching Assistants (Avengers), optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). JARVIS in general helps to organise and simplify
CS1101S tutors' administrative tasks.

## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of five components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.
* [**`Scraper`**](#scraper-component): Scrapes Sourceacademy.com for course-info.

Each of the five components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a student).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the address book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the address book data in json format and read it back.

### Scraper component
![Structure of the Scraper Component](images/ScraperClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Scraper.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/scraper/Scraper.java)

The `Scraper` component,
* reads user login information from the `UserLogin` object passed to it.
* can scrape `Source Academy`(https://sourceacademy.nus.edu.sg) for course-info such as missions, quests, student names.
* can save the scraped information to `Model`

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Get Missions Feature
In this section, we will introduce how the `Get Missions Feature` works. We will do so through showing the expected path-execution
and interaction of objects between the `ScraperManager` and `Chrome Driver`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** Chrome Driver is a web scraper software provided by Google Chrome. It comes packaged with your download of JARVIS.
</div>

![Path Diagram of Get Missions](images/GetMissionsPathDiagram.png)

![Sequence Diagram of Get Missions](images/GetMissionsSequenceDiagram.png)

* The strange-looking string within the `XPath.by(...)` is a HTML descriptor for the HTML element that corresponds to each individual mission on SA.
* The `Chrome Driver`, which is of type `WebDriver`, will look for all HTML elements on SA that matches the HTML descriptor we passed in.
* `WebDriver` will return a `List<WebElement>`, with each element in the list corresponding to a single CS1101S mission. This list could of size 0 if there are no active missions that day.

 <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** We discussed the workings of the getMissions() method here. In practice, the getStudents() and getQuests() methods work off a similar principle.
 </div>

### View Command
## Structure of View Command

The follow diagram shows the overview of the ViewComamnd Class Diagram:

![Sequence Diagram of View Mission Deadlines](images/ViewCommandClassDiagram.png)

In the `ViewCommand` class, there is also a static message `MESSAGE_USAGE` for when user does not include a second argument since view
has to take in at least one argument. The message will guide the user on what parameters the `ViewCommand` can take in.

In the `ViewCommandParser` class, under the `parse()` method, we reference the `Flag` class which is a class that encapsulates
the different flags that `ViewCommand` can parse. We use the `Flag` class to check for whether an input is valid and go on to parse
the flag and return the correct `ViewCommand` object.


## View Mission Deadlines Feature
In this section, we will introduce how the `View Mission Deadlines Feature` works. The sequence diagram for the View Mission Deadline Command is shown below:

![Sequence Diagram of View Mission Deadlines](images/ViewMissionDeadlineSequenceDiagram.png)

The `LogicManager` will call the `parseCommand` method of `AddressBookParser`, which then passes the second argument to the `ViewCommandParser` object.
The `ViewCommandParser` will return a `ViewMissionDeadlineCommand` object. This object will then be ultimately returned to the `LogicManager`. Next, the `LogicManager` will call the `execute(model)` method using the
`ViewMissionDeadlineCommand` object. In this method, it wil use the `Model` object to call the method : `updateMissionList()`, with parameter `PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_MISSIONS` which will show all the missions. When completed, the `execute(model)` will return a
`CommandResult` object with the success message to the `LogicManager`, indicating that the command execution is a success.

The View Quest Deadlines features work similarly to this as well.
=======
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** We discussed the workings of the getMissions() method here. In practice, the getStudents() and getQuests() methods work off a similar principle.
</div>

### View Students Feature
Next, we will introduce how the `View Students Feature` works. The following is a class diagram for View Student
 Commands.

![Class Diagram of View Student Commands](images/ViewStudentsClassDiagram.png)
* The abstract class `ViewCommand` extends from the abstract class `Command`
* Both `ViewAllStudentCommand` and `ViewOneStudentCommand` extend from the abstract class `ViewCommand`
* Both `ViewAllStudentCommand` and `ViewOneStudentCommand` take in a Model object for the execute method, as such
 both have a dependency on Model.


Now we will go into how the `View All Students Feature` works, the following is a sequence diagram modelling the
interaction between `ViewAllStudentsCommand`, `Model` and `CommandResult`.
![Sequence Diagram of View All Students](images/ViewAllStudentsSequenceDiagram.png)

* The `ViewAllStudentsCommand`'s`execute` method is first called with a model passed as an argument.
* `execute` method then calls `Model`'s `updateFilteredPersonList` method with a predicate which shows all students.
* A `CommandResult` object is created with the message "Listed all students taught by you" and returned to
 `ViewALlStudentsCommand`.
* The `CommandResult` object is returned to the caller of `execute`.

### View Tasks Feature
The View Task features involve viewing 4 categories of tasks which work similarly to the above as well. We can choose
to:
* View all `Task` in general,
* View all `Todo`, 
* View all `Event`, or 
* View all `Deadline`.

### View Consultations Feature
Next, we will introduce how the `View Consultations Feature` works. The following is a class diagram for View
Consultations Commands. There are three variants (view all consultations, view past consultations, view future
  consultations) but they all share the same logic.

![Class Diagram of the three View Consultations Commands](images/ViewConsultationsClassDiagram.png)
* The abstract class `ViewCommand` extends from the abstract class `Command`
* Both `ViewConsultationCommand` and `ViewPastConsultationCommand` and `ViewUpcomingConsultationCommand` extend
from the abstract class `ViewCommand`
* Both `ViewConsultationCommand` and `ViewPastConsultationCommand` and `ViewUpcomingConsultationCommand` take in a
Model object for the execute method, as such both have a dependency on Model.


Now we will go into how the `View Consultations Feature` works, the following is a sequence diagram modelling the
interaction between `ViewConsultationsCommand`, `Model` and `CommandResult`.
![Sequence Diagram of a general View Consultation](images/ViewConsultationsSequenceDiagram.png)

* The `ViewConsultationsCommand`'s`execute` method is first called with a model passed as an argument.
* `execute` method then calls `Model`'s `getConsultations` method with a predicate which shows all consultations of all students.
* A `CommandResult` object is created with the message "Listed all consultations: " and returned to
 `viewAllConsultationsCommand`.
* The `CommandResult` object is returned to the caller of `execute`.

## Structure of Add Command
The following diagram shows the overview of AddCommand Class Diagram:
![Class Diagram of Add Commands](images/ViewStudentsClassDiagram.png)

In the AddCommand class

### Add Task Feature
In this section, we will introduce how the `Add Task Feature` works. We can add 3 different types of tasks, namely
`Todo`, `Event` and `Deadline`.
* `Todo` is a basic simple tasks that is usually not constrained by time; `Event` is
a task that requires completion at a particular point in time; `Deadline` is a task that requires completion before a
particular point in time.

The sequence diagram for the Add Task Command is shown below:
![Sequence Diagram of Add Task](images/AddTaskSequenceDiagram.png)

* The `AddCommand`'s`execute` method is first called with a model passed as an argument.
* `execute` method then calls `AddCommandParser`'s `parse` method with a predicate which parses the task.
* A `CommandResult` object is created with the message "Task added"" and returned to `AddCommand`.
