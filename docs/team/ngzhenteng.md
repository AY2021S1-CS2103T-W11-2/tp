## Project: JARVIS

JARVIS is a desktop app for CS1101S Teaching Assistants (Avengers) to help Avengers keep track of their grading duties and consultations. The user interacts with it using CLI and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java and has more than 10kLoC.
Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to automatically switch to relevant tabs in the GUI when any command is inputted.
  * What it does: Allows the user to quickly look at the outcome of their input command.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product as it is important for the user to visualize the result of his
  /her input command. This feature also improves the cohesiveness of the application.
  * Highlights: This feature required me to fully understand the interactions between GUI and non-GUI
   components as well as the importance of abstraction principles in the implementation of new features.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=ngzhenteng)

* **Project management**:
  * Managed milestones `v1.1` - `v1.3` on GitHub
  * Ensured the team's completion of weekly deliverables such as demo videos.

* **Enhancements to existing features**: Added the ability to view a specific student simply using student's name
 substrings.
    * What it does: Allows the user to look for a student using a part of the full name.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product as it can be difficult to remember a student
    's full name. THe ability to search for a student using portions of the full name allows the user to achieve the
     true purpose of quickly and efficiently finding student information without the burden of memorisation.
    * Highlights: This enhancement is an enhanced version of the find feature in ab3, however this implementation
     displays all students that match the substring inputted by the user, regardless of whether the input is a full word.

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Created the first copy of the UserGuide in markdown format.
    * Added documentation for the features `view students` [\#72]()
  * Developer Guide:
    * Added implementation details of the `view one student` and `view all students` features.

* **Community**:
  * PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): [\#207](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/pull/207
  ), [\#53](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/pull/53)
  * Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples: [1](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/issues/249), [2](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/issues/258), [3](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/issues/255), [4](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/issues/250) [5](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/issues/253))

* **Tools**:
  * Used JavaFX libraries and CSS to create portions of the Graphic User Interface.
