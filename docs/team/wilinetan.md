## Project: Jarvis

JARVIS is a desktop app for CS1101S Teaching Assistants (Avengers) to help Avengers keep track of their grading duties and consultations.
The user interacts with it using CLI and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java and has more than 10kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to view deadlines for current Missions and Quests
  * What it does: Lists all the current ongoing Missions and Quests with their deadlines.
  * Justification: This feature allows users to keep track of the deadlines of Missions and Quests so that they know
  when they can start marking, and adjust their workload accordingly.
  * Highlights: This is a core feature for our app as it serves as a reminder for Avengers on their upcoming marking tasks
  so that they can manage their time.
  * Credits: *Selenium WebDriver for the ability to scrape for information on Source Academy*
  
* **New Feature**: Added the ability to view ungraded Missions and Quests
  * What it does: List all the ungraded Missions and Quests that the Avenger has yet to mark.
  * Justification: This feature allows users to keep track of the Missions and Quests that they have yet to mark so
  that they know specifically which Missions and Quests.
  * Highlights: This is another core feature for our app as it serves as a reminder for Avengers on which Missions and Quests
  they have to mark so that they can manage their time.
