## Project: JARVIS

JARVIS is a desktop app for CS1101S Teaching Assistants (Avengers), optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, JARVIS can get your TA administrative tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added Task features for Tutors to track their personal tasks.
  * What it does: Allows Tutors to Add and Delete Todos, Events or Deadlines.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product as it is important for the user to not only keep track of his
  responsibilities as a Tutor, he can also keep track of his personal work such as deadlines and assignments.
  * Highlights: This feature allows me to understand the main architecture of JARVIS from UI, Logic to Storage
  components. It is a very wholesome feature to add and I really enjoyed it.
   
* **New Feature**: Added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=asuraxsoul)

* **Project management**:
  * Managed milestones `v1.2 - v1.3` on GitHub

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Update GUI with "Todo", "Event", "Deadline" tags for user to easily see what type of Task is that.

* **Documentation**:

    * Added documentation for the features `add` and `delete`.
    * Update list of content with navigable links to each sections of the UG.
