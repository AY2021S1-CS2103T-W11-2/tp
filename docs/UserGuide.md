## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Introduction
Jarvis is a desktop app for CS1101S Teaching Assistants (Avengers), optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Jarvis in general helps to organise and simplify
CS1101S tutors' administrative tasks.

### 1.2 Purpose
As an Avenger, not only do you have immense power but you are also burdened with inevitable great responsibility.
Not to worry, Jarvis is here to empower you to manage your personal tasks while teaching others efficiently and
effectively.

### 1.3 Design Considerations
Our design philosophy that has guided us through the development of Jarvis is to place the user experience at the core of all considerations.
As such, you will find throughout the User Guide small features and language that we have deliberately chosen to enhance usability and improve the user-centered experience of our product.
We have highlighted several features below that we feel are reflective of our design philosophy.

1. You can toggle between your past and future commands entered by using the up and down arrows respectively.

1. Everytime a command has been entered, Jarvis will switch to the relevant tab automatically.

1. Important information such as `Student`, `Mission`, `Quest`, etc will not be deleted when the user keys in the wrong login information. We wish to give users the benefit of doubt and not delete their information as we do believe accidents can happen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. About the User Guide
This section aims to remind you of the important parts to take note of while reading the user guide.

### 2.1. Symbols
When reading this user guide, various symbols may appear occasionally to draw your attention to important information.
The meaning for each symbol is as follows:

Symbol | Meaning
-------| ------------
 ⚠️    | This symbol indicates that there is something important for you to take note of.
 ✏️   | This symbol indicates that an example is provided.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest _`jarvis.jar`_ and your operating system's _Chrome Driver_ from [here](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/releases/tag/v1.3).
It is crucial to have the Chrome Driver in order for Jarvis to start up. If the GUI does not launch,
please check that you have installed the correct driver:
    1. Windows: chromedriver.exe
    1. MacOS: chromedriver_mac
    1. Linux: chromedriver_linux
<br>
1. Copy both files to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your Jarvis.

1. There are two options for launching Jarvis.
    1. Double-click the `jarvis.jar` file to start the app.
    1. Launch Jarvis from the Windows Command Prompt or MacOS command line by navigating to the directory containing `jarvis.jar`,
    then typing the command `java -jar jarvis.jar`

    A GUI similar to the screenshot below should appear in a few seconds.

   ![Jarvis](images/userguide/Jarvis.png)

1. Upon start up, you will be prompted to log in to unlock Jarvis's
 full set of features.
 Please refer to the logging in segment below to complete your login.
 Do note that after editing your login details, exiting and relaunching the Jarvis User interface will take some time
 as Jarvis is attempting to log you into Source Academy.

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. E.g. typing help and pressing Enter will open the help window.
   Some example commands you can try:
   * `view -s:  Lists all Students.`
   * `view -s John Doe: Lists information about a Student named John Doe.`
   * `add -t DESCRIPTION: Adds a Todo task with specified description.`
   * `edit -s STUDENT_ID: Edits Student's Name, Email, Telegram.`
   * `exit: Exits the app.`
<br>
1. Refer to the Features below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Navigating Jarvis

Jarvis has a Graphical User Interface centered around a command input box on the top, surrounded by a light green
line. The green box below the command input box is the user feedback box. Jarvis provides feedback to the user through
this box.

### 4.1 UI Layout

   * The user interface is split into five separate segments.
        1. Top bar - Passive information, such as a summary for the user, greeting message, week number, topic for
         the week and today's date is presented to the user. An explanation on each information can be found below.
        1. Command Box - An input box for user's commands to be keyed in.
        1. Feedback Box - The feedback shown to the user for a given inputted command.
        1. Information Panel - A detailed list on the information stored within Jarvis.
        1. Tab Switcher - A tab switcher for browsing through the different types of information stored in Jarvis.
   ![Jarvis](images/userguide/uiLayout.png)

#### 4.1.1 Top Bar
   * The top bar includes the following components.
        1. Summary information - A quick summary indicating the number of ungraded `Missions` and `Quests`, upcoming
           `Consultations` and `Mastery Checks` as well as outstanding `Tasks` in Jarvis. Do note that graded `Missions` and
           `Quests`, as well as past `Consultations` and `Mastery Checks`, will not be indicated.
        1. Greeting message - A welcome message for you. If you are not logged in, this message will prompt you to do
         so.
        1. Weekly topic and today's date - The week count for the semester, together with the topic for the week and
         today's date.
        1. Shortcut icons - These icons are positioned here for your convenience to quickly navigate to Source Academy
         with the blue diamond on the left, and Jarvis' user guide with the white book icon on the right.
        1. Jarvis logo.

   ![Jarvis](images/userguide/topBar.png)

#### 4.1.2 Command Box

   * A text input box for all user commands to be keyed in. You may refer to a detailed guide on the various commands
    available in Jarvis. Hit the enter key to execute the inputted command.

#### 4.1.3 Feedback Box

   * A box that shows the corresponding feedback to the user according to the commands keyed in. If the command is
   successful, a success message will be shown. Otherwise, error messages guiding the user will be displayed.

#### 4.1.4 Information Panel
   * A detailed list of information that corresponds to the tab selected in the Tab Switcher on the left of the
    Graphical User Interface (GUI).

#### 4.1.5 Tab Switcher

   * The tab switcher contains clearly marked tabs: `Student`, `Mission`, `Quest`, `Consultation`, `Mastery Check`, `Task`.
   * `Todo`, `Event` and `Deadline` are all variants of `Task`.
   * Clicking on each tab will give you the information you require for that field.
   * The icons correspond respectively to the Source Academy and User Guide (this) websites.

<br>

 > ⚠️ The core features of Jarvis are based on `Students`, `Missions`, `Quests`, `Consultations`, `Mastery Checks` and
 > `Tasks`.
 >
 > ⚠️ Each core feature has a tab for the organisation of its information.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

To navigate the features, there are 2 methods which could be used individually, or mixed. We have designed
this flexibility with you, the user in mind.
 1. Only inputting commands into the box annotated "Enter command here..".
 1. Clicking on the tabs.
</div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Logging into Jarvis

The following is the prompt upon first login, you are prompted to key in your Source Academy username and password:

![NoLoginDetails](images/userguide/loginPrompt.png)

### 5.1 Prompt
   * The prompt contains the format of the edit command to be keyed in. The format is reinstated below for clarity.

To log in, simply edit your login details with the following command:
<br>**Format: `edit -l u/LUMINUS_USERNAME p/LUMINUS_PASSWORD`**
<br>Examples:
* `edit -l u/nusstu\e1234567 p/testpassword`

An example of the command being inputted:

![LoginUsernamePasswordInput](images/userguide/editLoginDetails.png)

### 5.2 Updated Details Summary
Within the red rectangle box, Jarvis will notify you if the login was successful and the login information entered. 
The username, password and student names are covered with a red rectangle for this diagram only to protect the Avenger's account security.
You will be able to see the login details you entered.

### 5.3 Updated Student Information
Upon success, all information from Source Academy will be visible to you. The student information tab will display you student information.
The `Telegram` and `E-mail` fields are test values as these information are not available on Source Academy.
You will have to edit them using the [Editing Student Information](#642-editing-student-information---s) command below.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Features

### 6.1 General Notes

#### 6.1.1 Notes about Command Format

   * Words in UPPER_CASE are the parameters to be supplied by you.
   <br> e.g. in `add -t DESCRIPTION`, `DESCRIPTION` is a parameter which can be used as `add -t Mark Missions`.

   * Items in square brackets are optional.
   <br> e.g `view -s [NAME]`, name is an optional parameter. It can be used as `view -s` or as `view -s [John]`.

   * Parameters can be in any order.
   <br> e.g. if the command specifies `t/TELEGRAM e/EMAIL`, `e/EMAIL t/TELEGRAM` is also acceptable.

#### 6.1.2 Notes about Jarvis' relationship with Source Academy
   * Students’ names that are under the Avenger will be fetched automatically from sourceacademy.nus.edu.sg upon startup.
   * LumiNUS username and passwords will be stored in plaintext.

#### 6.1.3 Notes about `Tasks`
   * Each `Task` you create, be it `Todo`, `Event` or `Deadline`, there will be an unique Task ID assigned to each of them, so
   that there will be no 2 of the same ID in your Task List at any point of time. The Task ID is reflected as
   <br>eg. D1, E5, T21
   * The first alphabet "T", "E" and "D" refers to `Todo`, `Event`, and `Deadline` respectively, and the number followed
   after the alphabet is the index of the `Task` you created with respect to all the `Tasks` you ever created.

### 6.2 Viewing help : `help`

Shows a message explaining how to access the help page.
<br>**Format: `help`**

* After the `Students`, `Missions` and `Quests` have loaded, take note that the `Telegram` and `Email` fields of the `Student` are placeholder values.
* This is because Source Academy does not contain these 2 fields of any `Student`. Editing the `Student` details will save the updated values.
* After a TA account has been used to log in and fetch the information, logging in with a non-TA account will not change the information displayed
as we choose to give you the benefit of doubt of keying in the wrong login details.
* Whenever a TA account is used to log in, the information will always be updated to reflect the logged in TA's `Student`,
`Mission` and `Quest` information.

Shows all past `Consultation` sessions.
<br>**Format: `view -cp`**
<br>✏️ Examples:
* `view -cp`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

When the `Consultation` time is the same as the local time (year, month, date, hour, and minute all equal), it is considered to have occurred in the past.
</div>

#### 6.6.9 Viewing upcoming `Consultations`: `-cu`

Shows all upcoming `Consultation` sessions.
<br>**Format: `view -cu`**
<br>✏️ Examples:
* `view -cu`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

* When the time of the `Consultation` displayed by `view -cu` is earlier than the local time (to year, month, date, hour, and minute) and then caught up eventually, it is still considered as an upcoming `Consultation` when you enter `view -cu`. This is to encourage the tutors to have this screen open while holding the `Consultation` session. When you switch to another command, such as `view -c` or `view -cp`, and then come back, you may see the updated filtered `Consultation` list with the current local time as the standard.

<br>✏️ Examples:
* `view -mcu`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

* When the time of the `Mastery Check` displayed by `view -cu` is earlier than the local time (to year, month, date, hour, and minute) and then caught up eventually, it is still considered as an upcoming `Mastery Check` when you enter `view -mcu`. This is to encourage the tutors to have this screen open while holding the `Mastery Check` session. When you switch to another command, such as `view -mc` or `view -mcp`, and then come back, you may see the updated filtered `Mastery Check` list with the current local time as the standard.

Jarvis data are saved in the file `jarvis.json` automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

Note that only `Student`, `Consultation`, `Mastery Check` and `Task` data are saved to the hard drive since `Mission` and `Quest` data
are likely to change frequently and hence, will not need to be persisted.
