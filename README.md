* This is **JARVIS, a personal butler for CS1101S Avengers**.<br>
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _JARVIS_) used for managing missions, quests deadlines, students' information and consultation timings for CS1101S tutors.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `JARVIS because it is the personal assistant to CS1101S tutors who are called Avengers, just like how JARVIS is the personal assistant to Iron Man in the movie Avengers`.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[JARVIS Product Website](https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-w11-2.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
